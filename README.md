Macroecology of Microbial Abundance in Soil and Aquatic Ecosystems Across the US

Overview
This study explores the role of microorganisms in soil and aquatic ecosystems across the United States, emphasizing their influence as both drivers and indicators of climate change. Using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), this research identifies key environmental factors affecting microbial abundance and evaluates their broader ecological implications.

Key Findings
Aquatic ecosystems: Microbial cell density is significantly influenced by specific conductance and water temperature.
Terrestrial ecosystems: Soil microbial biomass is primarily driven by soil temperature and soil moisture.
Microbial communities play a crucial role in the carbon and nitrogen cycles, influencing greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient cycling.
Statistical analyses using R show correlations between microbial populations and abiotic factors, helping to model climate change impacts.

Data & Methodology
Data Source: NEON microbial datasets (2014-2023) covering soil, water, and benthic microbial communities.

Analysis Tools:
R packages used: ggplot2, readxl, sf, ggspatial, scatterpie, maps
Techniques applied: Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)

Figures & Models:
Microbial abundance distribution across ecosystems.
Correlation matrices linking environmental factors to microbial density.
Principal component analysis of dominant variables.

How to Use the Data
Access the full dataset via NEON or the provided Google Docs link.
Use the provided R scripts for further analysis and visualization.
Modify parameters in the scripts to explore seasonal trends or specific microbial groups.
Applications & Significance
Climate Change Research: Understanding microbial responses to environmental shifts.
